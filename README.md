# Markdown practice


## To know how to properly write Markdown files
### So, what is this repo?

This is the first try I make to properly write a 
Markdown file. I am doing after watching the "Basic
Markdown" class in the Coursera course. 

The first thing I am going to practice is how to
make a list

* I am adding the first element of this list
* I am adding the second element of this list
* The third element is here too
